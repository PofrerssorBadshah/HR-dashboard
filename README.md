# 💼 HR Analytics Dashboard – Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview

This interactive **HR Analytics Dashboard** was created using Power BI to help HR teams identify key patterns in employee attrition, job satisfaction, and departmental performance. The goal was to turn raw HR data into **clear business insights** and help stakeholders take **data-driven decisions**.

## 🎯 Business Problem

The HR department was struggling to understand:
- Why are employees leaving the organization?
- Which departments or roles have the highest attrition?
- How do factors like income, satisfaction, and age impact attrition?

- 💰 Employees earning under ₹4000/month were **2x more likely to leave**
- 😕 Low job satisfaction (under 3/5) strongly correlated with high attrition
- 🧑‍💼 Attrition peaked in the **26–30 age group**
- 🛑 Low-performing teams showed signs of **quiet quitting** (low performance but low attrition)
